This app was forked from the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) provided as a part of Udacity's React Fundamentals Course. That code now lives in the project's `/server` folder.

The frontend was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and adheres to its typical structure/interface. It lives in the project's `/frontend` folder.

In order to run the project, first clone or download the GitHub repo. Then install the requirements by typing `npm install` in a terminal pointed to the `/frontend` diretory of the project (the directory that contains `package.json`, which lists the project dependencies).

To run the project locally after installing the requirements, type `npm start` into a terminal pointed to the `/frontend` directory to launch the development server. It should open `localhost:3000` and run the app in a local browser. If it does not open `localhost:3000` automatically, try doing so in your favorite browser. You should then see the app.

This app talks to a server provided by the starter template. The server should be run in a separate terminal. To run the server, install its requirements by typing `npm install` in a terminal pointed to the `/server` directory (cotaining its own `package.json`). Run it by typing `node server` into the same terminal once the installation is finished.
